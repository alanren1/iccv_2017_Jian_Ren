\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we address the problem of personalized image aesthetics, and introduce two new datasets to facilitate investigatio of this problem. We  propose a novel residual-based personalized aesthetics model for accommodating individual aesthetics taste with limited annotated examples. We also find that the attributes and contents are both important information for studying individual aesthetics preference. Furthermore, we introduce a new active learning method to interactively select training images and improve the training efficiency and performance of the personalized aesthetics model. One interesting future research direction is to investigate additional cues such as content redundancy, image quality or face recognition for improving user experience in real-world applications.
